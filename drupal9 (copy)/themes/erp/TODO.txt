# Things remaining
#

Functionality
-------------
Critial
-------
* A view for stock
* Goods recieve and purchase order refine linking/closing process. Make more like payments/invoice.
* Define rules about number formatting/precisions, field sizes etc.
* Numerical precision needs to be increased for pricing. 
  Currently float(10,2), (12,4) would be better and use round(x, 2).
* Totals should be a purely derived attribute - (except for payments).

Niceties
--------
* Move all _settings into erp.inc and rename to erp.module
* Create warranty module to track warranty returns
* Create more "transitions" processes, like job -> invoice
* Make stock codes clickable links in purchase orders.
* payment_type module needs a _settings section to allow editing payment types
* Allow user defined functions to be called to calculate price markup on
  import?
* Customisable price levels module needs doing.
* Documentation for installation/configuration
* CRM history


Polishing
---------
* Javascript in lots of places to fill in values for numbers.
* Make forms all look nicer
* Custom theme? or Custom module with nice icons like "controlpanel"
* Remove hardcoded settings from modules and make /settings menus (part done)
* Make generic function for saving invoice/po/quote/cash sale items and update
all modules.
* Consolidate images to one directory
* Look into the new "node as an OG" functionality they've been discussing
to use the "customer" node as the OG container. (implemented)
* Make instructions in "INSTALL" clearer on the use of groups etc
* Barcode scanning?
	Easy - PS/2 Scanner and line inputs up to tab down the page
* Relationships, so you can associate the options for a laptop with its node


Old Completed Tasks
-------------------
* Create .install files for all modules (completed)
* Multiple views for purchase orders - open, closed, all (completed)
* Change stock table to use "code" from item, not "nid" for the stock_code, as
  this is the "internally" used code, and thus multiple suppliers can supply the
  same code. (completed)
* Mark invoices as closed after receive payments (completed)
* Link invoices to payments and vice versa more completely (completed)
* Allow invoices to have multiple payments (completed)
* Qty on hand in pricing views? (completed)
* Change all tables to be erp_* (completed)
* Patch for OG to provide the groups in a list box, rather than as heaps of
	heckboxes. (completed)
