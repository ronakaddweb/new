This is erp for drupal 6.x

The install profile has been moved to its own project:

http://drupal.org/project/drupalerp

The notes below are just kept for info at the moment, and will
probably be removed in the longer term

----------------------------------------------------------------

To utilise the drupal install profile, follow these guidelines, 
assuming that DRUPAL is the base directory you unzipped the 
standard drupal archive in:

copy the erp.profile file to DRUPAL/profiles/erp/erp.profile
copy the rest of the erp files to DRUPAL/sites/all/modules/erp/ 
or DRUPAL/sites/default/modules/erp/ depending on your local 
policy.

We also require some extra modules as follows:

http://drupal.org/project/calendar/
http://drupal.org/project/context/
http://drupal.org/project/date/
http://drupal.org/project/gmap/
http://drupal.org/project/print/
http://drupal.org/project/quicktabs/
http://drupal.org/project/views/
http://drupal.org/project/workflow/

Unzip/Untar these into the DRUPAL/sites/all/modules/ directory, 
and they will create their own sudirectories. 

There is a script in contrib called get_modules.sh that will 
do this for you if you are unix/linux/probably mac based.

After all that, the "sites" part of my DRUPAL directory tree 
looks like this.

.
|-- all
|   `-- modules
|       |-- admin_menu
|       |-- advanced_help
|       |-- calendar
|       |-- cck
|       |-- context
|       |-- date
|       |-- dirtyforms
|       |-- gmap
|       |-- jquery_ui
|       |-- onbeforeunload
|       |-- print
|       |-- quicktabs
|       |-- remember_me
|       |-- views
|       `-- workflow
`-- default
    |-- files
    |   `-- js
    |-- modules
    |   `-- erp
    `-- themes
        `-- erp_theme

The erp_theme is just a copy of the theme directory from the
erp tarball

And finally, there is an erp specific autocomplete.js to copy 
into DRUPAL/misc/ which will auto insert prices when creating
quotes/invoices etc.
